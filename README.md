# Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify user reviews as either positive or negative, enabling efficient sentiment analysis. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, with `nltk` for text preprocessing, and applies a binary classification model to accurately predict sentiment from user-generated content.

## Project Overview

User reviews provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, preferences, and areas for improvement. Analyzing the sentiment of these reviews can help businesses better understand customer feedback at scale. In this project, a binary classification model was developed to categorize reviews into positive and negative sentiments, leveraging machine learning and NLP techniques. This repository contains all necessary code, preprocessing steps, and model training workflows required to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of user reviews.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Prediction**: Classifies reviews as either positive or negative using a binary classifier.
- **Text Preprocessing with NLTK**: Cleans and preprocesses text data by removing noise, stemming words, and eliminating stopwords.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Implements a binary classification algorithm, training and testing the model on labeled data to achieve high accuracy in sentiment prediction.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Primary language for implementing the model and data processing.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Provides various machine learning algorithms and tools for model evaluation.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Google colab Notebook**: For code exploration, testing, and visualization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Collected a dataset of user reviews, with labels indicating whether each review is positive or negative.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Text Cleaning**: Removed non-alphabetic characters from reviews to reduce noise.
   - **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words (tokens).
   - **Stopword Removal**: Removed common stopwords (e.g., "the," "is") using `nltk`'s stopword list to focus on meaningful words.
   - **Stemming**: Reduced words to their root forms using NLTKâ€™s `PorterStemmer` to standardize different forms of the same word (e.g., "running" to "run").

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Converted the preprocessed text data into numerical features using techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), making the data compatible with machine learning algorithms.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Trained a binary classification model (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machine) to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments.
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on a separate test set.

5. **Model Optimization**:
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance and accuracy.

6. **Prediction and Insights**:
   - The trained model can now predict the sentiment of new user reviews, helping to derive actionable insights from large volumes of textual data.
